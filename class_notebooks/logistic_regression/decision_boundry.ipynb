    "# Decision Boundary in Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "In logistic regression, the decision boundary is the hyperplane where the classification is switched from one class to another. For a binary classification and a decision _threshold_ of 0.5, the decision boundary is the set of points where the probability of each of the two classes is 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision boundary is a point when there is one feature, a line when there are two features, a plane for three features, and a hyperplane in the n-features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The equation of the decision boundary for any number of features\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation of the decision boundary is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$w_0 + w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + \\ldots + w_n x_n = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $w_i$ are the parameters of the logistic regression model and $x_i$ are the features. \n",

    "#### Proof (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "To see why this is the equation of the decision boundary, let's consider the logistic regression model:\n",

    "\n",
    "$\\sigma(w_0 + w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + \\ldots + w_n x_n) = 0.5$\n",
    "\n",
    "The logistic function is 0.5 when its argument is 0 (see [the plot of logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function)). So, the decision boundary is the set of points where:\n",
